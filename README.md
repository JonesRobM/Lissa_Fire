\section{Introduction}
HHG is a versatile process, finding utility as both a tool to explore the dynamics and structure of atoms and molecules using the harmonic generation process itself, and as a flexible source of short, bright, coherent pulses of high-frequency radiation for use in further experiments. 

One tool that has mostly lacked from this development is the polarisation of the emitted harmonics, which has been essentially confined to linear polarisations along the polarisation of the driving IR field. The lack of circularly polarised pulses completely eliminates
the extent to which the chiral structures of matter can be investigated.

The immediate response to this problem, of course, is to try to produce high-order harmonics using an elliptically polarised driver, but this does not work. The generation of high-order harmonics is in its essence a recollision-based phenomenon, and in the presence of an elliptical driver the three-step-model electrons will be shifted aside and miss the ion in their oscillations, quickly quenching the harmonic emission.
